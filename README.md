# hello-world
First Reposity. (Although I'm not quite sure what Repository means)

Hello everyone, hope you're having a nice day. I'm a college/University student. Got into coding about 2 years ago.
I code in C++, C# (mostly). Also familiar with HTML & CSS (that is IF they count).
I have been trying to understand how Github works using the Github guides tutorial. So, if anyone of you is reading this, I hope this tutorial is enough to understand this platform.
